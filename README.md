### Description:

Final year project that aims to focus on provding users with the ability to help manage and control their lifestyle by providing courses that focus on enhancing their current health. Implementation is focused on using the following: VS Stuido Code, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Bootstrap, SCSS and mySQL. The sysetm offers both front and back end design that allows the user to interact with each other.
